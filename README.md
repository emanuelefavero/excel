# Excel

This is a cheat sheet repo for Excel

> Note: In this tutorial I will be using Google Sheets, but the same concepts apply to Excel

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut        | Description                |
| --------------- | -------------------------- |
| Tab             | Go to next cell in the row |
| cmd + shift + v | Paste values without style |

## Tips

- You can add formulas to a cell by typing `=` and then the formula
- After typing `=` you can click on a cell to add it to the formula (e.g. `=C4*D4`)
- You can drag the bottom right corner of a cell to copy the formula to other cells
- Select multiple cells and drag the bottom right corner to copy the formula to multiple cells
